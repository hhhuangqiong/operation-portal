# Tools/Tasks

| **Script** | **Description** |
|----------|-------|
| prestart | Runs automatically before start. Calls remove-dist script which deletes the dist folder. This helps remind you to run the build script before committing since the dist folder will be deleted if you don't. ;) |
| start | Runs tests, lints, starts dev webserver, and opens the app in your default browser. |
| lint | Runs ESLint on build related JS files. (eslint-loader lints src files via webpack when `npm start` is run) |
| clean-dist | Removes everything from the dist folder. |
| remove-dist | Deletes the dist folder. |
| build:html | Adds trackJS tracking script and copies to /dist. |
| prebuild | Runs automatically before build script (due to naming convention). Cleans dist folder, builds html, and builds sass. |
| build | Bundles all JavaScript using webpack and writes it to /dist. |
| test | Runs tests (files ending in .spec.js) using Mocha and outputs results to the command line. Watches all files so tests are re-run upon save. |
| test:cover | Runs tests as described above. Generates a HTML coverage report to ./coverage/index.html |
| jenkins:commit | Runs by Jenkins on commit time for continuous integration. |
| jenkins:merge | Runs by Jenkins on merge time for continuous integration. |
